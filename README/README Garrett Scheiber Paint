    -New Features:
        GUI:

            Error window for unsupported file types
            Image "save" and "save as" through file explorer
            Save calls save as if no previous save location exists

            Can draw a line, but no other options

            Help window appears, but needs populated
            Scroll allows top menu hidden
    -Expected Next Sprint:
            Canvas modification
